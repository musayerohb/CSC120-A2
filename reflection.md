    When I first read the instructions, I looked through main.py and oo_resale_shop for a bit but couldn't figure out the instructions. So I went to office hours to just figure out how to get started. There, I learned what the attributes were and was able to repurpose the ones made in main.py to the computer class. To learn how to make the constructor next, I referred to the Onecard.py example we did in class, and took inspiration from that. That step especially made understanding what to do on this assignment much easier than before. 

    After that, I simply made a function in computer.py, and a new main.py file (testmain.py) to test this function, that would check if my computer constructor worked. This was a really helpful function to start testing my code and see if everything was running properly. Also, I can now recommend ALWAYS creating a test main file to make sure your code actually works. While VScode reported no errors to me, once I started testing the other functions I created in the computer and resale shop class, I realized that some of them didn't work properly. 

    Basically, I used the code in the procedural file to base my own code off of when making it object-oriented. I learned that I didn't have to change much because the assignment didn't demand it. 

    In short, my advice is, go to office hours if you need help and don't know what to do, look at examples we've done in class and always make a main file to test your code once you're done constructing it.
